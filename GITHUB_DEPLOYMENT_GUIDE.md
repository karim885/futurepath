# 🚀 Push FuturePath to GitHub

## Step 1: Install Git

### Windows:
1. Download Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/windows
2. Run the installer
3. Use default settings
4. Restart your terminal/PowerShell

### Verify Installation:
```bash
git --version
```

---

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

Once Git is installed, run these commands in PowerShell/Terminal:

### Navigate to your project folder:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\omen\OneDrive\Documents\UNI HAWK"
```

### Initialize Git and push:
```bash
# Initialize repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit everything
git commit -m "Initial commit - FuturePath complete web application"

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Add your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/youcefassidy/futurepath.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 3: What Gets Pushed

Your GitHub repository will include:

### ✅ Static HTML Website:
- `index.html` - Main website
- `app.js` - Functionality
- `OPEN_ME_FIRST.html` - Welcome page

### ✅ Full Next.js Application:
- All source code (app/, components/, lib/, models/)
- Configuration files
- All documentation

### ✅ Documentation:
- 8 comprehensive guides
- README with full instructions
- Setup guides

---

## Important: Create .gitignore First

Before pushing, let's make sure we don't upload unnecessary files.

The `.gitignore` file is already created! It excludes:
- `node_modules/` (heavy, reinstall with npm install)
- `.env` (secrets, don't upload!)
- `.next/` (build files)
- Other temporary files

---

## Alternative: GitHub Desktop (Easier!)

### 1. Download GitHub Desktop:
https://desktop.github.com/

### 2. Steps:
1. Install GitHub Desktop
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. File → Add Local Repository
4. Choose folder: `C:\Users\omen\OneDrive\Documents\UNI HAWK`
5. Click "Publish repository"
6. Choose name: `futurepath`
7. Click "Publish"

✨ Much easier than command line!

---

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages (Free Hosting!)

Once pushed to GitHub, you can host the static website for FREE:

### Method 1: Using GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/youcefassidy/futurepath
2. Click "Settings"
3. Scroll to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "main" branch
5. Click "Save"
6. Your site will be live at: `https://youcefassidy.github.io/futurepath/`

**Important:** For static version to work on GitHub Pages:
- The `index.html` is already in the root folder ✅
- The `app.js` is already in the root folder ✅
- It will work perfectly!

### Method 2: Using Netlify (Easier!)

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag and drop your entire project folder
3. Get instant live URL!
4. No account needed for basic hosting

## What Happens After Push?

### Your GitHub Repo Will Show:
```
futurepath/
├── index.html              ← Static website (visitors can use this!)
├── app.js                  ← Website functionality
├── OPEN_ME_FIRST.html      ← Welcome page
├── app/                    ← Next.js source code
├── components/             ← React components
├── data/                   ← Universities data
├── lib/                    ← Utilities
├── models/                 ← Database models
├── package.json            ← Dependencies
├── README.md               ← Your comprehensive docs
└── All other files...
```

### People Can:
1. **View your code** on GitHub
2. **Clone the repository** to run locally
3. **Use the static website** if you enable GitHub Pages
4. **Contribute** if you make it public
5. **Fork** your project

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Make Repository Public or Private?

**Public:**
- ✅ Anyone can see code
- ✅ Good for portfolio
- ✅ Can use GitHub Pages free
- ❌ Code is visible to all

**Private:**
- ✅ Only you can see
- ✅ Keep code secret
- ❌ GitHub Pages needs paid plan
- ❌ Not good for portfolio

### 2. Add Topics to Your Repo

After pushing, add these topics on GitHub:
- `nextjs`
- `react`
- `typescript`
- `career-guidance`
- `education`
- `ai`
- `quiz`
- `university`

### 3. Update README

The existing README.md is perfect! It includes:
- Project description
- Features list
- Installation instructions
- Tech stack
- Screenshots locations

### 4. Add a License

On GitHub, you can add a license:
1. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
2. Name it "LICENSE"
3. GitHub will offer license templates
4. Choose "MIT License" (most common for open source)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Git is not recognized"
→ Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
→ Restart terminal after installation

### "Permission denied"
→ Make sure you're logged into GitHub
→ Use GitHub Desktop (easier!)

### "Repository not found"
→ Make sure you created the repo on GitHub first
→ Go to github.com → New Repository → Name it "futurepath"

### ".env file showing up"
→ The .gitignore already excludes it!
→ Never commit .env files (they contain secrets)

---

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# First time setup
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/youcefassidy/futurepath.git
git push -u origin main

# Future updates
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push

# Check status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline
```
